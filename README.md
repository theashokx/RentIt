# RentIt – Local Rental Platform

## 🚀 Overview
RentIt is a location-based rental platform that allows people to rent daily-use items instead of buying them.  
Users can find nearby items, rent them for a short duration, and return them after use by paying a small rental fee.

This platform promotes:
- Cost efficiency
- Resource sharing
- Sustainable consumption

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Many daily-use items (helmets, tools, agricultural equipment, etc.) are used only once or a few times.
Buying such items is expensive and inefficient.

There is currently no simple, local, and trust-based system that allows people to rent items from nearby users.

---

## 💡 Solution
RentIt connects item owners and renters based on location.
- Owners list items for rent
- Renters find nearby items and book them
- The platform charges a small commission per transaction
